## Generations

The Volkswagen Polo has gone through six main generations:

- **First Generation (1975-1981)**: The original Polo was introduced as a rebadged version of the Audi 50. It was available as a three-door hatchback and featured simple, economical engines ranging from 0.9L to 1.3L. This generation established the Polo as Volkswagen's entry-level supermini.

- **Second Generation (1981-1994)**: Known as the Polo Mk2, this generation was available in three body styles: hatchback (Polo), sedan (Derby/Polo Classic), and coupe (Polo Coupe). The Mk2 featured improved engines, including the first diesel option, and underwent a significant facelift in 1990.

- **Third Generation (1994-2001)**: The Polo Mk3 brought more modern styling and improved safety features. It was available in three and five-door hatchback variants, as well as a sedan version called the Polo Classic. This generation introduced the GTI badge to the Polo lineup for the first time.

- **Fourth Generation (2001-2009)**: The Polo Mk4 featured a more mature design, improved build quality, and enhanced safety. This generation received the European Car of the Year award and was offered with a range of gasoline and diesel engines, including the sporty GTI variant.

- **Fifth Generation (2009-2017)**: Based on Volkswagen's PQ25 platform, the Polo Mk5 grew in size and quality, offering features previously found only in larger cars. This generation won the 2010 European Car of the Year and introduced the powerful Polo GTI with a 1.4L TSI engine.

- **Sixth Generation (2017-present)**: Built on the MQB A0 platform, the current Polo is larger, more technologically advanced, and offers a wide range of driver assistance systems. It features modern TSI and TDI engines, a digital cockpit option, and continues the GTI tradition with a 2.0L turbocharged engine.
