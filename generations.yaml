generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Type 86)"
    start_year: 1975
    end_year: 1981
    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Polo was introduced as the company's new entry-level model, positioned below the Golf in size and price. Based on the Audi 50 (which was discontinued in 1978, leaving the Polo as the Group's sole offering in this segment), the original Polo featured a simple, boxy design with a sloping rear in three-door hatchback form, while a 'sedan' variant with a separate trunk (marketed as the Volkswagen Derby) was introduced in 1977. Measuring just 3.5 meters in length, the Polo was designed for maximum space efficiency within minimal exterior dimensions, addressing growing demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient cars following the 1973 oil crisis. Engine options were limited to small-displacement four-cylinder units including 895cc, 1.1-liter, and 1.3-liter petrol engines producing between 40 and 60 horsepower, paired with four-speed manual transmissions. The interior was basic but functional, with simple controls, minimal comfort features, and practical touches like folding rear seats in the hatchback variant. Despite its modest specifications, the first-generation Polo established Volkswagen's presence in the supermini segment that would grow in importance in subsequent decades, offering the brand's characteristic quality and engineering in a smaller, more affordable package while creating a template for subsequent generations as the model evolved into one of Volkswagen's core global products."

    end_year: 1994
    description: "The second-generation Volkswagen Polo represented a significant evolution rather than a revolution, maintaining a similar mechanical layout to its predecessor but with more modern styling and enhanced features. Initially available in familiar three-door hatchback and two-door 'sedan' (now renamed Polo Classic) body styles, a distinctive 'breadvan' variant called the Polo Coupé was added featuring a more upright rear end that improved cargo capacity despite its sporting name. A significant facelift in 1990 (sometimes referred to as the Polo 2F) brought updated styling with more rounded elements and improved equipment. Engine options expanded to include a wider range of petrol units from 1.0 to 1.3 liters, and for the first time, a 1.3-liter diesel, with power outputs ranging from approximately 40 to 115 horsepower in the limited-production G40 supercharged variant. Transmission choices remained centered on four and five-speed manuals, with automatic options limited in most markets. The interior saw improvements in design, quality, and features, though still maintaining a relatively basic, functional approach in keeping with the model's positioning. This generation had a remarkably long production run, remaining in manufacture until 1994 in Europe and even longer in some other markets, with continuous updates helping maintain its competitiveness throughout this period. The second-generation Polo significantly expanded the model's market presence and reputation, establishing it as a key player in the growing supermini segment particularly in European markets where its combination of quality, durability, and affordability appealed to a broad range of customers from first-time buyers to those seeking a practical second car."
